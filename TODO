vim-gschem -- gschem syntax highlighting in vim

- add comments to 'hi link' items
- determine a text string which unambiguously says that file is gschem's
- add paths support
- model-name - how to correctly show this attribute?
- should I highlight all 'name=value' texts as attributes?
- add support of old gschem formats?
- text highlighting for the text size of 1 doesn't work but the text is displayed in gschem; should the spec, determining 2 as the least text size, be changed?
- the highlighting doesn't work with default gnd-?.sym symbols, they contain trailing spaces; should we support them?
- add Makefile to install vim syntax files?
